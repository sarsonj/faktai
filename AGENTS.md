# Agent Working Rules

## Change Requests
- All changes must be handled through the Change Request process in `doc/change-requesty/`.
- Unless explicitly told otherwise by the user:
  - create/update a CR record for the requested change,
  - keep `doc/change-requesty/README.md` in sync,
  - implement and commit changes under the approved CR scope.

## Time Tracking Sync
- When updating development time data in root `README.md`, always update `doc/vykaz-vyvoje.md` in the same commit.
